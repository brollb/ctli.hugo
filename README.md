# The CTLI Project Web Site

To add a page to the web site, either push commits to this repository 
or fork the repository, add content, and submit a pull-request.

To add content, you can manually create markdown files under the 
`content/` directory (you can use existing content as models) or
if you have [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) installed on your computer you
can create a file for new content with 
`hugo new content/blog/my-new-content.md`
from a command prompt in the root directory of the project.

Text formatting uses the
[blackfriday](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday) markdown
processor, which follows the CommonMark standard with a few extensions.

You can also just put your content in whatever form is convenient for 
you to the `web` channel of the project's Slack workspace and I will 
add it to the site.
