# Climate change project

We are developing tools to facilitate using the NetsBlox system to download and analyze data on climates in earth's past. 
Examples include measurements of carbon dioxide concentrations and temperature for the last 800,000 years of earth's history
that were recorded in the massive ice cap that covers Antarctica. Students will use NetsBlox to organize and analyze this 
data, producing graphs that show changes over time and relationships between different properties of the climate system.

Other data will include measurements of local weather from stations around the United States.
